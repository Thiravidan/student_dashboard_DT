1. In the original dataset ("DT Data Champion Assignment"), I calculated the basic and advanced screening scores in a separate sheet.  
2. I copied the names along with the basic and advanced screening marks before combining them into the "test2tp" Excel file.  
3. I wrote a Python script to combine both datasets, which produced the output in the "processed_data_case_insensitive" Excel file.  
4. I copied this processed data into the original dataset ("DT Data Champion Assignment") and applied conditional formatting, completing Task 1 by creating the dashboard.  
5. I copied the Task 1 data into the "task1.xlsx" file, then wrote a Python script to automate the dashboard, producing the final output in the "updated_dashboard.xlsx" file.  

Finally, I added the solutions to the last sheet of the original Excel file ("DT Data Champion Assignment") and final solutions folder
